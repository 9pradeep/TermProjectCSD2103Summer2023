Provide a brief description of your front end code architecture including folder structure, API consumption, etc.

The Front-end code for this project is developed using HTML,CSS and Bootstarp to make it as responsive as possible. JQuery and Ajax are used to extract the data from the Back-end and display it dynamically in the frontend. The other resource files such as js, scripts and images used in the site such as logo and static images are stored in the seperate specific folders. This way the structure of the system is designed in effetive way so that later on changing code the code access is easier.
